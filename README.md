# Monochrome color theme for Emacs

Copy of [eink-emacs](http://github.com/maio/eink-emacs) project with personal preference.

# Changes:

- No size changes
In my opinion bold style is enoght to highlight a header
- String literals have bold style
- Keywords have less contrast color
It is need to recognize a difference between keyword and rest of the source file content but not to be overfocused of that things.
